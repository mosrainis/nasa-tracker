# NasaTracker

NasaTracker is an open-source web application that tracks Nasa activities and displays them for users.
Asyou can see, this is just the first step and there are so much work to do but for now, we have just one tool ready to use.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

### Astronauts In Space
I'm using http://open-notify.org/ API to show the list on astronauts.
You can watch for all astronauts that currently living in space. This basic tool also automatially gives you a wikipedia page about these astronauts. feel free to try it.
